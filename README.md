# Dog Friendly
- Welcome to Dog Friendly! This is my phase 5 project. I plan on using this to keep track of where I can bring my dogs, and slowly expand it to my friends so we can easily share where we can bring our dogs. It is never fun to hear you can bring your dog because of some incorrect Google Maps information, so I would love to fix that. I learned and implemented Redux Toolkit as something to teach myself for this project.
